Humans Vs. ChatGPT Reasoning Ability

**Overview**
This project explores the differences in reasoning and communication between human-generated content and AI-generated responses using data from the r/eli5 subreddit and GPT-based models. The primary focus is on analyzing text features extracted from the LIWC 2015 library and applying machine learning models to understand these differences.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project consists of posts from the r/eli5 subreddit:

**Questions**: Titles of the posts
Human Responses: Top comments to these posts
GPT Responses: Responses generated by GPT-based models

**Methodology**
Text Feature Extraction
Text features are extracted using NLP and Transformer-based methods.
LIWC 2015 library is utilized to extract specific linguistic features.
Analysis
Machine learning models are applied to analyze text features.
Key categories studied include:
Reasoning ability
Logic and coherence
Deductive reasoning
Explanation quality

**Tools and Libraries**
Python, NLTK, Transformers, LIWC 2015 library
Machine learning frameworks (e.g., Scikit-learn, TensorFlow)
